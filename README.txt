# Dustin Hartnett ENPM661-Project-2

This code requires the numpy, queue, time and cv2 libraries

To run the code...

1) save the code to a folder in your computer and then navigate to that folder in your terminal

2) run the code, and when prompted in the terminal, input the x and y coordinates of your desired start and goal coordinates in this order: Startx, Starty, Goalx, Goaly

3) the code will compute the optimized path to the goal from the start node, and then create a video called "dhartnet_Project2.mp4" that will publish to the folder that the .py file is saved in
